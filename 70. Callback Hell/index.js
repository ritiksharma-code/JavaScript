/* 
    Callback Hell = SItuation in JavaScript where callbacks are nested
                    within other callbacks to the degree where the code
                    is difficult to read. Old pattern to handle asynchronous
                    functions.
                    Use Promises + aynch/await to avoid Callback Hell
